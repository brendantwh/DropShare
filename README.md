You can try DropShare with the 
[APK here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1twGKHqLi9lodZutKGMOBu_XdGRPrNY2x/view). 

The debug banner shows on the top right of the app to mark this as a development build and not a release build.
**This is intentional.**

From Milestone 2, all accounts have to be created with NUS emails only.

On the sign up page, only domains ending with **nus.edu** or **nus.edu.sg** will be allowed to create an account.

For testing purposes, you may choose to use the test accounts which have full access.
